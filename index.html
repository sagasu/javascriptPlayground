<h1>Hello, check the console. And set debugger to setInterval functions in strictScript.js</h1><br>
<span>
    The interval function is being executed every second, for each object: person, person2 and person3<br>
    Notice that w/o using arrow function (person3), or casting this to self (person2) in strict mode this is created for<br>
    each function call, that's why there is no access to age property in person class.
